Launched in May 2019, M³@Choa Chu Kang taps on the strengths of resident volunteers and community leaders to serve the needs of the Malay/Muslim individuals residing within the Choa Chu Kang GRC. It is guided by the values of the GRC's one B.I.G. family — "Beautiful”, “Inclusive” and “Gracious”. It aims to support young couples, families with children, vulnerable individuals and youth of the Malay/Muslim community in Choa Chu Kang. 

M³@Choa Chu Kang actively collaborates with its M³ partners to roll out a wide range of programmes at Choa Chu Kang and Keat Hong. These include the KelasMateMatika (KMM), the Marriage Preparation programme and the Marital First Responder programme, which trains community volunteers to provide basic peer marriage support.  

M³@Choa Chu Kang also supports the Yellow Ribbon Project in helping ex-offenders to reintegrate and contribute towards our society. 

At Bukit Gombak, M³@Choa Chu Kang taps on its network of volunteers there to offer a Mentorship programme for Malay youths.
