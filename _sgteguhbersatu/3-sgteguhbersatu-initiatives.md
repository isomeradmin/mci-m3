### **SGTeguhBersatu Initiatives**

#### **Initiatives for Ramadan**

##### **Ramadan 2020 Handbook – Contemporary Irsyad Series Vol. 2**
The Office of Mufti introduced the Ramadan 2020 Handbook, [“Contemporary Irsyad Series Vol 2”](www.muis.gov.sg/officeofthemufti/irsyad) to guide the community in practising their faith during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Handbook will emphasise the role of Singaporean Muslims as citizens in practising social responsibility to curb the transmission of COVID-19. It includes several religious advisories that have been issued during this outbreak. Other related frequently-asked religious queries that have been put forth by the members of the public are also addressed in the Handbook.

##### **#SGUnited Buka Puasa**
The #SGUnited [Buka Puasa](www.bukapuasa.sg) initiative is a ground-up effort to provide meals for breaking of fast during the month of Ramadan. Daily meals will be extended to two groups within the community, i) healthcare professionals and their families; and ii) Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (Muis)’ *zakat* beneficiaries and other families who require the provision of meals during this challenging time. This initiative aims to express our gratitude and solidarity with those on the frontlines of the battle against COVID-19 and to support those who are significantly affected by the outbreak.
